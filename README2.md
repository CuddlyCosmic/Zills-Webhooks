# Zills-Webhooks
This is for Zill but im literally making it. Anyways hi. 

Uh... tf do i put here LMAO. okay, ill just put updating information here for the Webhooks. 
not exactly here in the "README.md" but,... obviously in the webhooks dumba-

Heres the rules to refresh your pea sized brains <3 
RULES: 

1 - No bullying, harassment, or arguments. Keep your thoughts to yourself. 
Bullying and harassment can lead up to an upsetting outcome for the one getting abused,  don't judge anyone else, and they won't judge you. {Punishment for R1: Mute for 1h} 

2 - Dont go against administration or Owner{s}. 
Going against code could cause not only for you to get in trouble and be upset by the outcome, but also those around you. repeatedly breaking rules, mistreating administration, and so on could lead to a ban. so do be wary about yourself. and show respect. {Punishment for R2: MIN: 24H Mute - MAX: Ban.} 

3 - NO VENTING OR SH/SA TALK IN GENERAL. 
Multiple people would be fine with listening to you vent and talk about things, but here, we like to let those people talk separately in Dms, instead of the group. venting in a big group chat like this could cause a lot of people to go uncomfortable, be it from their own past experiences, or being a pretty heavy trigger warning for others. so with all due respect, keep venting and SH/SA talk out of the general, and rather in DMS. being a victim myself, I'm sure most of you would understand <3

{Roleplay Rules:}

1 - How to roleplay properly -
Although there really isnt a proper way to roleplay, this way would be alot more better and less confusing for those around you to understand. Now, when roleplaying you are if not always roleplaying as a character of some sort, be it an OC {Original character} Cannon OC {Cannon original character from game or show.} or so on,  youll be needing to use actions and so on to interact with the things around you.

The way most people interact with things would be saying it normally. like 
"Steffen was walking through the forest." 
Although you're getting the point across, its not very proper to say on its own. 
so instead, try using asterisks on each side of the sentence. that way, it'll look a bit more different, like this for example. 
"Steffen was walking through the forest." Now you can tell it's an action, right? that way people won't be confused between a character talking and a character doing an action. {You could also use -these- on each side as well if you cant use asterisks - BTW: These * are asterisks.}

Now, the sentence looks fine on its own, but it would look better if you added detail around it, that way people around you that want to roleplay with you can have a better grasp at what's surrounding you, that way they can use their character... Heres another example; stemming off of the sentence previously; 
"Steffen was walking through the forest alone,  the sound of wind blowing softly around him as he walked quietly, the sound of the woods groaning under the sky's weight."

What did you notice? the addons of more adjectives, and verbs, right? the more you add, the more you can make a picture out of the sentence. but there's something missing.. Oh, that's right, your character's description! how silly of me to forget. Now, you probably already have a good idea on how to do this, right? Either way ill show you one last example :) remember to think of your character as something real and 3d, that way you can have a more physical idea of the creature or character you're playing as. 

Final example: 
"Steffen was walking through the forest alone, his light blue eyes staggering and looking around briefly, as his teeth chattered in the cold wind. the wind around him blowing softly as the sound of his boots could be heard, stepping on each leaf, leaving a loud crunch as he walked. the sound of the trees groaning under the skys weight could be heard as he walked, hoping no one else was around but.. he was bound to bump into something or someone soon.."
It's always funner giving other objects personification too! it's like writing a story, only.. in real-time and with others. try your best! and don't think you have to respond quickly during a roleplay, always give the other person time and they should give you time too. Hope you have fun :> - Cosmic
